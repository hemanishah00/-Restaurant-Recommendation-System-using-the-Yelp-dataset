CF-Linear : This file conatins the collaborative filtering model build on the concept of using residual matrix which uses latent space for items and users. It is linear as we are only using linear relationships.

CF-NonLinear: This file conatins the collaborative filtering model build on the concept of using residual matrix which uses latent space for items and users. We use neural networks to deduce the non-linear relationships between the latent space of user and item.

Recommendations- We use the concept of social networks in yelp to determine restraunts recommendations. We consider the places rated by the user and her/his friends. We take the restraunts not rated by the user amongst them and generate predictions on how a user will rate those places. We provide the highest rated restraunts according to our model for the user.

#### Use of Database ####

The use of database has been done for querying the data so as to only keep the required data in the RAM.
